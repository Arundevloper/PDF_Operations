- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express.js

### How to Run

#### For Frontend:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the frontend folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Run the project by executing `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### For Backend:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the backend folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Run the server by executing `npm start`.
5. The server will start at port 5000. Modify this according to your needs.

## Modifying Server Port
You can modify the port on which the server runs by changing the configuration in your backend code, typically in the file where the server is initialized (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`). Look for the line where the server listens to a port, and you can change `5000` to any port you prefer.

Remember, before running the backend server, ensure that your MongoDB server is running and accessible. You might need to configure your backend application to connect to your MongoDB database.
